From Greek χῶρος choros 'area/region.' A Choropleth is a type of thematic map in which a set of pre-defined areas is colored or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area, such as population density or per-capita income. Choros or Tsoros was also the ruling clan of the Ööld and Dörbet Oirat and once ruled the whole Four Oirat. Their chiefs reckoned their descent from a boy nourished by a sacred tree.
